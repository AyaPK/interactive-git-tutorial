### Sublesson: Stage a file
Hint: Type 'git add README.md'
Objectives:
- Stage README.md | git add README.md |

`git add` moves changes into the staging area so they can be committed.

Like real git, this command produces no output on success — check the Repository State panel to confirm the file moved to the staging area.
