title: Introduction to Git

### Theory

Git is a **version control system** - a tool that tracks changes to your files over time.

Think of it like a detailed save history for your project. Instead of keeping files like `report_v1.docx`, `report_v2.docx`, and `report_FINAL.docx`, Git lets you save snapshots called **commits** and move between them freely.

**Why use Git?**

- **Track changes** - see exactly what changed, when, and who changed it
- **Undo mistakes** - roll back to any previous state of your project
- **Collaborate** - multiple people can work on the same codebase without overwriting each other
- **Branch** - experiment in isolation without affecting the main codebase

**How this tutorial works**

Each lesson introduces a concept, then gives you a terminal to practice in.
You can use the commands you learn in any lesson, at any time, and if you forget them you can use the `help` command to remind yourself.

**In this lesson**

In this lesson, we will simply run the help command and see what commands are available to us.
