title: Introduction to Git

### Theory

Git is a **version control system** — a tool that tracks changes to your files over time.

Think of it like a detailed save history for your project. Instead of keeping files like `report_v1.docx`, `report_v2.docx`, and `report_FINAL.docx`, Git lets you save snapshots called **commits** and move between them freely.

### Why use Git?

- **Track changes** — see exactly what changed, when, and who changed it
- **Undo mistakes** — roll back to any previous state of your project
- **Collaborate** — multiple people can work on the same codebase without overwriting each other
- **Branch** — experiment in isolation without affecting the main codebase

### How this tutorial works

Each lesson introduces a concept, then gives you a terminal to practise in. The **repository state panel** on the right shows you what Git "sees" at any moment — your working directory, staging area, and commit history.

You only need to focus on the terminal and the instructions on the left. The panel on the right updates automatically as you run commands.

### Sublesson: Using the tutorial terminal

Welcome to the interactive Git tutorial! You'll learn Git through commands in the terminal below.

Type commands and observe the output + the repository state on the right.
